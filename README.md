# minishell_unit_test

lil test for minishell project.

i will not update this thing as the more i improved it, the more i realized that my minishell was
a shit :)

So no update, those test are a good base of what is expected from you
(issue open)

DO NOT USE THIS TEST on evalutations. this is too `strict` :'(

## TODO

nothing more, is up to you to get in your way.
