# minishell_unit_test

lil test for minishell project.

for a comparison, here is my [minishell](https://github.com/Pixailz/ft_minishell) i don't pass all the test but my grade was 101, so this is a good exemple of not being too **strict** for this project

DO NOT USE THIS TEST in evalutations. this is only to prepare the evalutation

## HOWTO

running this scripts will output only the test that failed, additionnaly it will
create a [deepthought](./deepthought) file with details and all the test that's been done

> here's the help from `./run --help`
